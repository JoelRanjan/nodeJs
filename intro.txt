6.How nodejs works(architecture)?
    whenever client raises a request, requests will be set into the "event queue" , event loop will check each request whether its a blocking 
    or non blocking request. then it executes instatntly if its non blocking request.
    otherwise it will send the request to a "thread pool" to execute.
    Treadpool has workers. each worker will take each request and execute.
    default no. of workers in threadpool == 4
    to check no of workers ==> os.cpus().length
